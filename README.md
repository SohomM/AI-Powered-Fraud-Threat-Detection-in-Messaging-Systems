'''AI-Powered Fraud & Threat Detection in Messaging Systems'''

Here's a comprehensive project that analyzes messages (SMS, emails, chat apps) to detect:
1. Financial fraud (scams, phishing)

2. Tax evasion hints ("let's deal in cash to avoid tax")

3. Threats & extortion ("pay or we'll leak your data")

4. Malicious links & attachments

   System Architecture
1. Message Ingestion → 2. NLP Analysis → 3. Threat Scoring → 4. Alerting

   Core Implementation (Python)
1. Setup & Dependencies
   pip install nltk pandas sklearn flask python-dotenv twilio


   Key Features
Multi-Layer Detection

Rule-based keyword matching

Machine Learning classification

Sentiment analysis for urgency detection

Tax Evasion Focus

Detects phrases like:

"Let's avoid GST"

"No invoice needed"

Real-World Integrations

Can connect to:

Twilio API (for SMS monitoring)

Gmail API (email scanning)

Telegram/Slack bots (chat monitoring)

Extensible for Compliance

Logs all flagged messages for audit trails (useful for RBI/SEBI compliance)


Why This Project?
1. Relevant for Cybersecurity Jobs: Demonstrates NLP + threat detection

2. Financial Compliance: Catches tax evasion patterns

3. Real-World Impact: Can prevent actual fraud if deployed
